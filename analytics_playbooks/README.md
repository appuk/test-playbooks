### Analytics Playbooks

These consist of Playbooks that can be used to generate some edge case scenarios for Templates in Tower. This will be eventually used to:
 - evaluate how Tower ships these Templates and their jobs to Automation Analytics
 - Verify that the Automation Analytics processor handles all kinds of Templates and Jobs
 - Verify the Automation Analytics feature itself to make sure it is calculating all the metrics correctly
